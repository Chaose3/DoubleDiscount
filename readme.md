## Description
This project is a Bloons TD 6 (BTD6) Discount Calculator designed for **ISAB**, who loves **Discount Villages**! It allows players to calculate the total cost of towers and upgrades while factoring in discounts from Monkey Villages and difficulty settings.

## Features

- ✅ Apply discounts from **up to 3 Monkey Villages**.

First Discount Village  ->  15% discount

Discount stacks and affects additional villages too!
```

## Difficulty Modifiers
